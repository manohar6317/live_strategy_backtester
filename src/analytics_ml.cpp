// analytics_ml.cpp: Implementation of MLAnalytics class for machine learning-based trade analysis
// Purpose: Classifies trading strategy performance and detects market regimes using ML techniques
// for the BTC/USDT trading system, enhancing strategy optimization

#include "analytics_ml.hpp"  // Header file defining MLAnalytics class
#include <iostream>          // For console output (logging ML analysis results)

// Classify the trading strategy based on trade data
// trades: Vector of Trade structs from backtesting or live trading
// Why: Uses machine learning to evaluate the MovingAverage strategy's effectiveness
// Note: Placeholder implementation; needs actual ML classification logic
void MLAnalytics::classify_strategy(const std::vector<Trade>& trades) {
    // Log strategy classification process for debugging
    // Bug: Placeholder; should implement ML model (e.g., classify as profitable/unprofitable)
    std::cout << "Classified strategy based on " << trades.size() << " trades\n";
}

// Detect market regime based on trade data
// trades: Vector of Trade structs
// Why: Identifies market conditions (e.g., trending, volatile) to optimize strategy decisions
// Note: Placeholder implementation; needs actual ML-based regime detection logic
void MLAnalytics::detect_regime(const std::vector<Trade>& trades) {
    // Log regime detection process for debugging
    // Bug: Placeholder; should analyze trade patterns for regime classification
    std::cout << "Detected regime based on " << trades.size() << " trades\n";
